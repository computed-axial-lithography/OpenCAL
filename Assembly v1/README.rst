Introduction
------------
The current status of OPENCAL is underdevelopment. The system will comprise of mostly 3D printed parts, which can be manufactured in any research laboratory or on a standard desktop 3D printer with no custom machining. Many components are commercially available via Amazon and McMaster. I will include an updated BoM in the coming days that contain everything necessary to build your CAL setup. Stay tuned.
