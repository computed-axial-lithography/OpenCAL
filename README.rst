The current status of OPENCAL is underdevelopment. The system will comprise of mostly 3D printed parts, which can be manufactured in any research laboratory or institute with little to no custom machining. Some parts will be required for purchase, including 8020 beams, ThorLabs optical posts and lenses, standard ball-bearing, and GT2 Timing pulley and belt attachments for Nema 17 stepper motor. Check back in soon for an updated BoM and CAD files.
